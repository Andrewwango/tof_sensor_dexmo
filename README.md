## Adding ToF sensor interface to Dexmo SDK
This project adds 5 new finger tracking DOFs to the Dexmo force-feedback glove, and is part of [Dexta Robotics](https://www.dextarobotics.com). The project is integrated into the [Dexmo Unity SDK](https://www.dextarobotics.com/en-us/sdk) via the files [here](TofSensorUnity).

Read the [docs](TofDocumentation) to understand what happens inside!
